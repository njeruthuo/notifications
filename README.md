## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I collected all the users and added them to an object which I iterated over and used conditional rendering to display the properties not found in other objects

### Built with

- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- TailwindCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### Continued development

As usual, if you have a better way of doing anything in this project, hit me up asap

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.
